[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> ```python
>> import numpy as np
>> import thinkstats2
>> import thinkplot
>> %matplotlib inline
>> %config IPCompleter.greedy=True
>> ```
>>
>> Generate random sample of size 1000
>>
>> ```python
>> rand=np.random.random(size=1000)
>> rand[:10], len(rand)
>> ```
>>
>> Constructing and plotting PMF
>>
>> ```python
>> rand_pmf=thinkstats2.Pmf(rand,label='random pmf')
>> thinkplot.Pmf(rand_pmf, linewidth=0.08)
>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel ='random',ylabel='PMF')
>> ```
>>
>> Constructing and plotting CDF
>>
>> ```python
>> rand_cdf=thinkstats2.Cdf(rand,label='random cdf')
>> thinkplot.Cdf(rand_cdf)
>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel ='random',ylabel='CDF')
>> ```
>>
>> Taking a sample 1000 values generated by np.random.random shows that the PMF is not very uniform there are gaps in the PMF plot that indicate this. However if we generate a higher sample size this becomes more uniform.
